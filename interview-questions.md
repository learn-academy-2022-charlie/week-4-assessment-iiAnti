# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:props is what reacts uses to pass on state key values to a component. I can be used in the main react app as well. it allows for us to change the property of the main DOM by takin in the class objects and passing it down. I use props a a lot when i'm using react. usually I make a property in the component call withing the app.js and pass it on in a component with the term this.props instead of this.state.

  Researched answer: props are like arguments in javascript. We can use these props to send data for component and then form the component to another component. It makes it easier to keep track of data and allows us to not have to rewrite things over adn over. YOu can pass strings, variable, and objects. They are dynamic attributes when using objects. As we can set the property to any value in the object. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: The Document Object Module is what we see as a user. It's is the HTML output that's changed and and reloaded as the user scrolls or interacts. This is where state comes into play quite well. the DOM uses state to cange the state of the dom when it is being interacted with. Anything we do or change within our project will affect the DOM. Even CSS will change the DOM. 

  Researched answer:so I was about half correct. The DOM is more of an html for you javascript. It is no the HTML itself. It is what allows us to interact and change things on a webpage so easily. you need javascript for it. If you didn't have javascript it would not work. The DOM build a tree like form when inspected where as with HTML you could see the frame work as a whole with all the attributes. The DOM can either be worked on in a js or jsx. jsx is a little more preferred as it has easier ways of navigating around, that is once you get used to it. If we are still a little confused perhaps, just thing of a button on a webpage. The only way it will work is with the DOM that is connected to an interactor such as jsx. 




3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:OOP is the process of coding with only blocks such as we do with ruby. As in ruby it is all blocks and we use methods in ruby and are used as their own type of function to run conditions. You can use an object within an object.

  Researched answer: OOP focuses more on the objects rather than logic. They make it easier for objects to be reused and scaled across a whole program. We use objects, classes, methods, and attributes in OOP. we have four main princciples of OOP: Encapsulation, which allows us to privatly keep the state and it's objects info provate when we want it to be provate, Abstraction, this is kind of the same thing as encapsulation, but it allows for the neccassary info or code to be shared with other objects. Inheritance, this allows us to share class infomation between other classes. Polymorphism, this is like using props and passing down data.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: a float always gives back a decimal so you can use it to get a more precise piece of info. An integer is a whole number that can be used as a number or in a string to get a number.

  Researched answer: If we use an integer to try to get an answer per say it's 2 divided by 567, it will give use an integer answer but if we were to just turn the 2 into 2.0 we would get a more precise answer. I found that floats are considered real number in ruby because of the acutal occurance of the value you recieve but I also found that with integers we need to use _ to call in a larger number as ruby does not take in , when using integers. floats will take dominance over and integer. If you add one float and one integer the outcome will be a float.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: this means that we dont need a return in our methods like we do in javascript. So we can just use the do/end process and have it all work with a p which stants for print usually. That willl output the code we want returned.

  Researched answer: so i was basically correct. The main thing I didn't define was that if you dont have a return in ruby it will return that last expression evaluated. so we would could have more than one expressons in a method, but if we don't have a return, we will get the last one ruby read befoer it outputted anything.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: these are variables that take @ to store data. This data can me accessed with methods and you define them within classes. the methods do what you want and IV knows what you want.

2. PostgreSQL: this is a huge data base that allows apps and sites to function and store things properly with ease. It supports most languages. It's kind of like a huge folder.

3. Ruby on Rails: this is framework that separates thw work into three seprate sections. the model, view, and the controller. THe framework is like a custom pre build frame. You can follow as it tells you to do or you can take it from there and make it into you own.

4. ORM: This is a way to interact with objects in thw language of you choosing. IT's a data base that lets you get into other sources and manipulate what you want to do with the object.

5. Active Record: this is the model of the MVC. it represents all the data and logic one used.
